<h1>Davids Movie Reccomendations</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Finding Nemo</h3>
<p>I love this movie because the determination Marlin has to find his son resonates with me because it shows he's willing to do anything to save his son.</p>
<h3>Lion King</h3>
<p>Lion King is one of the classics of Disney and it takes themes from Hamlet. I really enjoyed this movie and it used to be my number 1 before Finding Nemo came along. </p>
<h3>Beauty and The Beast</h3>
<p>The theme of love is what really caputered my attention here and it showed me that anyone can change because as we see the Beast is a bad person until Belle helps him change his ways.</p>
